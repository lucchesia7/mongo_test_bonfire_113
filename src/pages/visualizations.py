'''
To return information about a item from a database to a user in a friendly format.

Query the database based off a user input, the display the information back to them.

Why is this important?
When a user wants to search information, and we don't have a local file to reference to,
We can use a query function to return the data instead.


How do we go about this?
First, we will test it in a notebook environment.
We will use our database to return the information
use a .find() function to grab that information.
